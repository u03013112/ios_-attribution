## SKAdNetwork 4.0 概述

    Use “4.0” as the version number when signing ads for this version.

    You’re eligible to receive a version 4 postback if all participants meet the following conditions:

    The ad network generates an ad signature for version 4.

    For ads that appear in an app, the app is built with iOS 16.1 SDK or later. For web ads, the ad appears in Safari 16.1 or later.

    The advertised app is App Store-signed and is running on a device with iOS 16.1 or later.

    Advertised apps built with iOS 16.1 SDK or later can register up to three conversions that result in postbacks for the winning ad impression. Apps built with earlier SDKs can register only one conversion, resulting in one winning postback.
